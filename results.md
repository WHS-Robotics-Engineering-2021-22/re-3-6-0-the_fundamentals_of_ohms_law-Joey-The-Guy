#### Hover over any point in the ciruit to get the voltage drop and current values for that part of the ciruit. What is the total current (IT) for the circuit?
If I'm understanding current, it's five.
#### Calculate total resistance for the circuit (RT)?
1.5
#### Based on this answer, explain what the reistance is for the LED (RLED1)?
The resistance of the Led is 0.48
#### Use voltage drop for the LED to confirm your answer. Was there a difference? If so, why did this happen?
It looked like there was a difference, I would asume that some of the energy was expelled as light.
